My first foray into blogging was twenty years ago and from 2004 to 2015 I ran a popular group blog for academic philosophy. At the time blogging was a great way to collaborate with other people in our field, get feedback on work in progress, and to some extent raise your profile in the profession. It was great for young philosophers and those in small departments without peers working in close areas. The rise of social media and micro blogging on Twitter moved a lot of those conversations into walled gardens. A decade later sites like Twitter, now X, have become largely a hellscape. Conversations are now split across Threads, Mastadon, Bluesky, X and others. Picking a site to contribute on feels more like picking a BBS back in the early 90's. So maybe it's time for a return to long form posting on the public internet.

I'll probably post mostly professional content about data, analytics, engineering, product and engineering management. Kick me if I post about philosophy, whiskey, fly fishing, cycling. I don't have a schedule or goal, so expect posting to be sporadic.
