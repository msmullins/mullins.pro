iIt sounds like so many posts you might read on LinkedIn, but it's from Barry Devlin and Paul Murphy's 1988 paper An Architecture for a Business and Information System based on work they'd done the previous two years at IBM. The paper lays out the architecture of the modern data warehouse for the first time. Along the way it anticipates the medallion architecture with its layered views, data catalogs with the Business Data Directory, and distributed databases with Data Distribution Manager.

It's a really brilliant piece of writing looking back thirty-six years. It set the stage for Inmon's Building the Data Warehouse (1992) and Kimball's The Data Warehouse Toolkit (1996). Perhaps most remarkable is how many of the challenges outlined in the paper remain challenges for the data practitioner today despite realizing faster platforms, better tools, and flexible architectures.
